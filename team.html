        <h2>The team</h2>
 <h3>coach</h3>
        <p>
          In football, the coach is the person responsible for managing a team within a football club or national team.
</p> <p>
There are two similar variants: the manager (a common term in the UK), who theoretically has extensive responsibilities over the club's sporting policy, and the coach, in the case of national teams, whose responsibility is also to choose the best selectable players.
</p> <p>
The coach is responsible for the results of his team to the leaders of the club.
        </p>

        <h3>Position of players</h3>

        <p>
         Governed by Law 3 of football, it is composed during an official match of eleven players maximum on the field.
</p> <p>
A team is composed of a goalkeeper and ten outfield players, who divide the positions according to the tactical device chosen. The positions are divided into three broad categories (defenders, midfielders and strikers), they are attached to roles and playing areas on the field. The expression "midfielder" replaced "half" in the 1970s, and has since been accompanied by a qualifier: recuperator, relay, offensive; lateral or axial. A team usually consists of one goalkeeper, three to five defenders, two to five midfielders and one to four forwards.
        </p>
<h3>organisation</h3>
        <p>
          The distribution of positions changed over the course of football history. In his early days, outfield players were divided into forwards, halfbacks, and backs. At the end of the nineteenth century, football teams played classically in "2–3–5", consisting of two backs, three halfbacks and five strikers. In the mid-twentieth century, the general models of the game changed from W-M, the first global strategic organization in four lines, to the game in three lines (4-2-4 then 4-3-3 and 4-4-2 during the years 1970-80).
</p> <p>
As the game evolves, tactics and formations evolve, and positions with them. The disposition of the players can also be considered according to whether the team is at the initiative of the game or if it adapts to that of its opponent. The device is then imposed or redefined.
        </p>

        <h3>numbers</h3>

        <p>
          Player numbers initially correspond to player positions. In a simplified distribution:

goalkeeper (target);
right back;
left rear;
centre-back;
centre rear ("backward", "unhooked from cover", "libero" in the catenaccio, "lock" in the Swiss name of "lock", ...);
defensive midfielder;
full-back midfielder or right winger depending on the spatial devices (or even corridor player like the No. 2 right-back);
midfielder ("relay", "intermediate");
centre-forward ;
forward/leader ("advanced", "free", "playmaker"...);
left winger or left midfielder or corridor.
</p> <p>
In modern football and the expansion of the bench to a large number of players, the numbers are no longer significant of the function occupied or the zone. However, in reference to world-class players who have worn this or that number (Kopa 9; Di Stéfano, Platini, Zidane 10; Cruyff 9, 10 or 14, Ronaldo, Figo, Griezmann 7;...) These numbers (1, 7, 9 and 10 especially) are often used by players who actually hold a renowned function and also wish to be their worthy successors. In the strategic language and analysis of collective sports games for game theory, we speak of assignment to mean that a number is assigned to a player and that it can be associated with functions responding directly or indirectly to functions or utilities in the game.
